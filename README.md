### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Rishab here
 
I'm a Graduate student doing my Masters in Information Systems at the College of Engineering in Northeastern University, Boston.

I'm interested in Fullstack Engineering, Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps!

Prior to my studies at Northeastern, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer in Persistent Systems. I was mainly involved in the development and maintenance of Alissa Interpret Web Applications and various other REST Api projects. I was heavily working with Deployment of the applications on cloud including building the entire pipeline, Infrastructure as Code using Terraform, Security and other cloud related activities
